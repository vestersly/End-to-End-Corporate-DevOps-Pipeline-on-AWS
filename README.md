# End-to-End-Corporate-DevOps-Pipeline-on-AWS
Project Overview This project demonstrates a complete, production-grade DevOps CI/CD pipeline built from the ground up on AWS. It automates the entire software delivery lifecycle for a Java-based web application, from a developer's code commit to a highly available deployment in a Kubernetes cluster. 
Core Features & Technical Showcase
This project showcases expertise in a wide range of DevOps domains:
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Cloud Engineering:
Secure Network Foundation: Deployed a custom Amazon VPC with distinct public and private subnets spanning multiple Availability Zones for high availability and fault tolerance.
Managed Kubernetes: Utilized Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for a scalable and resilient container orchestration layer, with worker nodes securely placed in private subnets.
Secure Connectivity: Implemented a NAT Gateway for secure outbound internet access for private resources and a Bastion Host for secure administrative access.
CI/CD Automation with Jenkins:
Declarative Pipeline-as-Code: The entire workflow is defined in a Jenkinsfile, promoting version control and reproducibility.
Automated Build & Test: Integrated Maven to automatically compile the Java application and run unit tests.
Artifact Management: Published versioned .jar artifacts to Sonatype Nexus Repository for reliable release management.
DevSecOps - "Shifting Left" on Security:
Static Code Analysis (SAST): Integrated SonarQube to automatically scan code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells on every build.
Container Image Scanning: Utilized Trivy to scan Docker images for known vulnerabilities before they are pushed to the registry, preventing insecure images from reaching production.
Kubernetes Security Posture: Scanned the Kubernetes cluster configuration with Kube-audit to identify security misconfigurations.
Containerization & Orchestration:
Docker: Containerized the application for consistent and portable deployments.
Amazon ECR: Used Amazon's Elastic Container Registry for secure, private storage of Docker images.
Kubernetes Deployment: Deployed the application to the EKS cluster using declarative manifest files (deployment.yaml, service.yaml).
Observability & Monitoring:
Centralized Logging: Configured Amazon CloudWatch to collect VPC Flow Logs, EKS control plane logs, and application logs for unified monitoring and troubleshooting.
Notifications: Integrated Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) for robust, decoupled pipeline status notifications (success/failure).
(If you implement the final part): Deployed Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring of application and system-level metrics.

How to Run This Project
(Here, you can add brief instructions on how someone else could replicate your setup, which further demonstrates your deep understanding.)
Provision the AWS infrastructure (VPC, Subnets, EKS, EC2 instances).
Install and configure the tooling (Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus) on their respective servers.
Set up the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins pointing to this GitHub repository.
Trigger the pipeline with a git push to the main branch.
Access the deployed application via the Application Load Balancer URL.
Action Plan
Create the public repository.
Push the vprofile-project code to it as we discussed.
Create a new file in the repository named README.md.
Copy and paste the text above into your README.md file.
Commit the new file.
